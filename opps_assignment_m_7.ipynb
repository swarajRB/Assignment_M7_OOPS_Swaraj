    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "1. Classes and Objects:\n",
    "    * Classes are blue print of templet for creating an object. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Object: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation: \n",
    "    * Means bundling of data and methods of class by using some acess modifiers like private, protected, and public to protect the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: \n",
    "    * It is the concept of hiding complex impletation hidinh the unnecessary details and only exposingthr requird .\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * This simplifies interaction with objects and helps in focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance:\n",
    "    * It refers to process of child receiving the properties of parent class\n",
    "    * The mechanism by which a new class (subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism :\n",
    "    * Polymorhism refers to  poly mean many and morphism means forms and stae\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods / state\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The ability to define a single interface or method that can be used by objects of different types. It allows methods to be overridden in subclasses to behave differently based on the objectâ€™s type, while still maintaining a common interface.\n",
